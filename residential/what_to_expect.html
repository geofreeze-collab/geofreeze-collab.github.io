								<h2>What to expect</h2>
								<p>When you call Geofreeze, we will request as much information as you can provide
									describing the symptoms of your problem.
									This information will be provided to the structural engineer who will visit your
									home so that he will be prepared to
									assess your situation.</p>

								<h3>What is Geofreeze’s process?</h1>
									<p>An experienced structural engineer will be
										scheduled to visit your home to do an
										inspection and assess the problem and
										then provide a written document (an engineer’s report or a proposal for
										remediation,
										whichever you prefer.) There is a
										modest charge for this professional service, which will be credited to you if
										Geofreeze
										subsequently performs the
										construction on the property for you.
										The representative who takes your call will:
										explain the fee structure and assessment procedure
										gather information about the structure of your home and the problem you are
										experiencing
										explain the difference between an engineer’s report and a proposal for
										remediation
										answer your questions
										schedule an appointment, and
										mail you an appointment confirmation.
										Approximately three weeks after the assessment by the structural engineer you
										will
										receive the written report or
										proposal. If , however, you have an emergency or time-critical situation,
										Geofreeze
										will
										respond promptly and work with
										you to address your needs.</p>

									<h3>What information will Geofreeze request? Typical questions we will ask you
										include:</h3>
									<div class="link-list">
										<ul>
											<li> What condition(s) prompted you to call Geofreeze?</li>
											<li>What style is the home (i.e. townhouse, split-foyer single family,
												two-story
												colonial,
												one-story ranch, etc.)</li>
											<li> Is the home constructed above a basement? A crawl-space? Or an
												earth-supported
												concrete
												floor at the ground surface?</li>
											<li> How old is the home?
											</li>
											<li> How long have you lived in the home?</li>
											<li>Where in the house do you observe the symptoms?</li>
											<li>Can you describe the symptoms?</li>
											<li>Have the symptoms occurred gradually or did they appear to occur
												relatively
												suddenly?</li>
											<li> Have you previously attempted to correct the problem?</li>
											<li> If repairs have been attempted, did you do them yourself or retain and
												engineer or
												contractor to assist with the work.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>

									<p>Note: For ideas on how to recognize and describe symptoms of distress in your
										home,
										visit the section of this website
										<a href="symptoms_solutions_diagonal.html">Symptoms and Solutions.</a></p>

									<p>Additionally, we will ask for other pertinent information about the property such
										as:
									<div class="link-list">
										<ul>
											<li> The location of the property?
											</li>
											<li> Your address if different from the property involved?
											</li>
											<li> Are you the owner? Potential buyer?
											</li>
											<li> How to reach you – phone numbers, fax, email address?
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>

									<p>The more information you can provide and the more specific you can be, the more
										effectively Geofreeze can assist you.</p>
