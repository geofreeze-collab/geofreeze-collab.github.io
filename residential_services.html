								<h2>Our Residential Services</h2>
								<h3>"I think I have a problem."</h3>
								<p>This is the first thing most homeowners say when they call <b>Geofreeze</b>. They are
									concerned about symptoms
									they see in their homes and they are pleased to find that <b>Geofreeze</b> provides
									engineered solutions to
									solve structural problems in homes.</p>
								<h3><b>Geofreeze</b> can help you if:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>You have cracks in your walls or ceilings
									</li>
									<li>You have settled walls or floor areas
									</li>
									<li>You wish to deepen a basement or convert a crawl space into a basement
									</li>
									<li>You wish to repair or construct a retaining wall
									</li>
									<li>You need to re-grade your property or add drainage improvements to improve storm
										water management
									</li>
									<li>You wish to reinforce or alter the structural support of your home
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b>Geofreeze</b> does not:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Offer basement waterproofing except in association with structural repairs
									</li>
									<li>Offer remodeling services
									</li>
									<li>Offer hardscaping or landscaping services except in association with structural
										repairs.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<p><b>Geofreeze</b> will start by providing a structural engineer's assessment of your
									problem, identify the causes
									of the problem and then suggest a remedy to solve the problem. You will receive
									a professional engineer's
									report and cost estimate for the recommended remediation.</p>


								<h2>Foundation Underpinning</h2>
								<p>The foundation of your home is supported on soil or rock. If this material changes
									volume for any reason, the foundation
									may settle and crack. The solution to the problem is to extend the affected
									foundation down into firm, less compressible
									material. This process is called "foundation underpinning." There are several
									techniques available for foundation
									underpinning. All have advantages and disadvantages. The most cost-effective
									approach for a particular situation depends
									on the geology of the site, the type of existing foundation construction and access
									for completion of the work.</p>
								<p>In the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area, foundation settlement is most frequently
									caused by the consolidation of
									poorly compacted fill or volume changes in clays that are affected by changes in
									their water content. These materials
									are frequently referred to locally as "marine clays." They are most prevalent in the
									Potomac River Valley, but may be
									found in isolated pockets throughout the area.</p>
								<p>Some noticeable symptoms of settlement are "stair step" cracks in masonry walls,
									sloping floors and doors or windows
									that don’t function properly. The settling process can be arrested and frequently
									the settled foundation can be
									re-leveled by the process of foundation underpinning.</p>

								<h2>Basement Wall Reinforcement
								</h2>
								<p>The basement wall of your home is effectively a retaining wall. It is designed to
									support the pressure of the soil and
									water outside the wall, as well as the weight of the house. If the combined forces
									exceed the design capacity of the
									wall it may bow in and crack. Abnormally high water in the soil during seasonally
									wet periods of the year is the primary
									cause of overstressing of basement walls. The expansive forces exerted by marine
									clays may aggravate the problem.
								</p>
								<p>Some noticeable symptoms of overstressing of your basement wall are long horizontal
									cracks that “stair step” up or down
									near the corner of masonry walls. In cast concrete walls the cracking frequently
									appears as a vertical crack more or
									less in the center of the wall with diagonal cracks on either side going upward from
									the floor towards the ceiling. The
									process is usually cumulative as the wall is overstressed and bows further with each
									wet season. If the conditions
									causing the distress are not addressed, the affected wall may eventually collapse.
								</p>
								<p>The problem may be corrected either by eliminating the cause of the distress or
									reinforcing the wall to support the
									excess pressure. The latter approach is frequently much less expensive and
									intensive. There are several methods of
									reinforcing basement walls. The most cost-effective solution for a particular
									situation will depend on the type of wall
									construction, the extent of the existing distress and access for completion of the
									work. Frequently, improvements in
									storm water drainage on the property are all that is required to effectively
									eliminate overstressing and arrest further
									distress.
								</p>

								<h2>Concrete Floor Re-leveling
								</h2>
								<p>Concrete floors, patios, sidewalks and stoops frequently settle and crack because of
									consolidation of poorly compacted
									fill soil beneath them. Broken sewer or water pipelines beneath the floor may
									aggravate the problem. For small or
									limited areas it may be appropriate to remove and replace the concrete if further
									settlement won’t occur. For larger
									areas, particularly where there is the possibility of ongoing settlement, the floor
									may be re-leveled by hydraulic
									"mud-jacking" or mechanical piers. The latter approach is more certain when the fill
									soil beneath the floor may be clay.</p>

								<h2>Crawl Space to Basement Conversion (Basement Deepening)
								</h2>
								<p>Lot size, historical limitations, or some other constraint may lead to the
									determination that the conversion of a crawl
									space to a finished basement area is the most cost-effective way to increase the
									living area in a home. Also, many older
									homes have basements with headroom clearance that is too low to allow the basement
									to be finished and used as a living
									area. In these circumstances, it is possible to deepen the supporting foundation and
									concurrently mine the soil from
									beneath the house to create a suitable basement. This procedure frequently requires
									modifying the buried utilities
									beneath the house. It may also be desirable to modify the subfloor support system to
									obtain a more desirable use of
									space.</p>
								<p>These combined procedures are frequently most attractive in historic, inner city
									areas where space is limited and "row
									house" style construction is common. The end result of this type of conversion is an
									increased heated/air conditioned
									living area without altering the exterior of the home.</p>

								<h2>Retaining Walls
								</h2>
								<p>It may be desirable to build a new retaining wall where none previously existed or
									rebuild a retaining wall that is
									deficient. Any wall more than three feet high will require a permit in all of the
									jurisdictions around the Washington,
									D.C. metropolitan area. This requirement has arisen because of the numerous
									residential retaining wall failures that
									have occurred. Retaining walls have frequently been constructed primarily as
									landscaping features without adequate
									engineering. With proper engineering there are a wide range of alternatives for wall
									materials and appearance that will
									perform properly.</p>
								<p>Retaining walls constructed on steep slopes generally require more engineering and
									are more expensive to construct.
								</p>

								<h2>Structural Renovation
								</h2>
								<p>You may wish to remove a column that obstructs an area, open up a doorway or remove a
									wall. Geofreeze can assess, design
									and complete these kinds of structural alterations. If you have plans for the
									existing building, as well as knowing your
									desired changes, this will expedite the assessment and reduce the cost of the work.
