								<div class="testimonial">
									<p class="headline">Foundation Underpinning &amp; Site Drainage Improvements</p>
									<p>I had a number of companies come out and inspect my home in 2012 after I noticed
										severe drywall cracks in the
										1990 addition to the original 1964 home and stairstep cracking in the bricks of
										the original house. I was very
										impressed with Geofreeze's inspection, Mr. Schuster took the time to show me
										what was going on (typical Virginia
										clay soil shrinkage tilting down the back part of the addition foundation,
										exacerbated by very poor to
										nonexistent drainage on one side of the addition.) What really impressed me is
										he said I didn't need to do the
										work, the house was structurally sound, although shrinkage and compression of
										the soil would continue over the
										decades. However if we wanted to sell the house a buyer would probably want the
										work done. He broke down
										suggested work into three priorities, with the drainage being the most
										important. It impressed me that he was
										honest about the work not being necessary for safety and taking the time to
										explain everything to me. We decided
										for a number of reasons to have the work done in 2013. </p>

									<p>It took about two weeks to do the work, and they did a great job. His crew is
										wonderful, very experienced and
										very hardworking, and no subcontractors which is important to me, everyone works
										directly for Geofreeze. They
										had engineers out at various points in the process to inspect what the crew was
										doing and make sure everything
										was running smoothly. They ran into a problem with the sloping on the drainage
										system, and changed the plans to
										make sure the resloping would correctly funnel the water into the drains. It
										looks better than before they
										started! I added rebricking of two old basement windows (that opened into
										storage closets) to the work order and
										they did a beautiful job, you can't tell a window was ever there. </p>

									<p>Foundation work is not a do-it-yourself project. You need an experienced firm
										that knows what they are doing. I
										would strongly recommend Geofreeze for foundation work. </p>

									<p class="headline">Marc Lederman: Masonry Wall Reinforcement</p>
									<p>Our perimeter foundation in the lower level of our home is concrete block in a
										nearly 50 year-old house. That
										wall is set in the ground and the home had experienced some movement in that
										wall across the entire back of the
										house over the years. We noticed some of this when we were looking at the house
										to purchase through the exposed
										wall in the garage and our initial assessment before purchase was that this was
										a long-term issue due to the way
										in which the backfill was done during the home's construction. At the time of
										purchase we had horizontal
										cracking only with very little movement in the wall. But over the 20 years we
										have lived in the home the damage
										had become somewhat more pronounced, including movement of the wall
										(approximately an inch and-a-half) in the
										corner of the garage with a vertical crack from joist to floor that allowed
										water to leak into the garage
										whenever we had a reasonably heavy rain.</p>

									<p>Through Angie's List I came across Geofreeze as a professional and skilled firm
										with an excellent reputation. I
										was looking for a firm with a professional engineering team, experience across
										the broad spectrum of needs in
										our area, and a firm with an in-house crew to actually do the work. </p>

									<p>John Shuster came out to take a look at our problem and I was impressed with his
										professional demeanor and the
										way in which he assessed our problem. The issue was water seepage into the soil
										creating an abnormally high
										saturation of the soil and excessive hydrostatic pressure again the basement
										wall. </p>

									<p>A few days later I had a written assessment and an estimate for the repair and
										decided to have Geofreeze do the
										work. The solution was to place vertical steel reinforcements and non-shrink
										high strength cement grout in-fill
										into the hollow masonry. Additionally, vertical carbon fiber straps were placed
										every 4 inches along the inside
										of the garage wall. Also, a narrow structural steel header was bolted into the
										existing first floor joist system
										and the entire wall and adjoining wall sealed/painted with Dry Lock.</p>

									<p>My experience with Geofreeze was excellent. From my first contact with John to
										the work conducted
										by the repair crew, to continued enjoyment of our dry basement. I have continued
										to be pleased with
										the way in which the repair has been effective in arresting the wall movement,
										stopping the water
										from entering, and the impressive way the repair looks, it is difficult to tell
										that there was ever a
										problem.</p>

									<p>I highly recommend John Shuster and Geofreeze for the array of services they
										provide and the
										excellence of their work.</p>

									<p>What an absolute JOY to walk downstairs this AM and see a DRY living room!!</p>
									<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
									<p>After <u>10 long</u> years of dreading any forecast that included rain... I am
										just beginning to allow myself to
										remember what a blessing the sight and sound of rain can be.</p>
									<p>Every step of this process, every encounter with Geofreeze employees has been
										professional, timely and "serviced"
										with a genuine smile and caring presence.</p>

									<p class="headline">Earth Anchored Basement Wall Repair</p>
									<p>We contracted with GeoFreeze upon the enthusiastic recommendation of two other
										clients one with a big retaining
										wall project, and one with a complete foundation repair.</p>

									<p>The estimate appointment went very smoothly, and the estimate we received was
										clear and thorough. We ended up
										waiting quite a while to have the work done, but the original estimate was
										honored. </p>

									<p>The job itself went incredibly well. The crew arrived promptly and was thoroughly
										professional. The job was done
										well, as far as I can tell with my layman's eye ' it's now four years later, and
										everything still looks perfect.
										During the installation, the crew went way above and beyond the call of duty,
										completely cleaning out a
										downstairs storage room adjacent to the job and installing plastic to contain
										falling insulation. The room, as
										well as the entire area, was spotless when they left. </p>

									<p>GeoFreeze is not the cheapest contractor, but in this case you really get what
										you pay for, and then some. They
										are truly professional structural engineers who know what they are doing and
										conduct themselves with the utmost
										professionalism. I would use them again in a heartbeat.</p>

									<p>I affirm that Geofreeze, Inc. provided the services described and that I
										authorize publishing my comments on the
										Geofreeze website.</p>

									<p class="headline">Concrete Floor Releveling</p>
									<p>I am writing this letter to tell you how enamored I have been with Geofreeze and
										the professionalism of your
										employees. This professionalism started with my initial inquiry about having my
										basement slab raised. You were
										very courteous and helpful in our initial conversation and I immediately knew
										your company would do a good job.
									</p>

									<p>The structural engineer came to my house to evaluate the problem. He was very
										knowledgeable and friendly. He
										explained what had to be done in terms that I could understand and put me at
										ease for taking on this project. I
										appreciated his knowledge and years of experience. Once again I knew that I had
										selected the right company for
										doing this job.</p>

									<p>The work crew that did this job was extremely professional. I was impressed with
										their work ethic and the respect
										that they showed for me and my home. I have found that in today's times many
										workers seems to do the job just
										for a paycheck and it was wonderful for me to see that this was not the case
										with your employees. They were
										dedicated and professional. They did not mind me watching the process and were
										always willing to let me watch
										and they answered any of my questions in a courteous and professional manner.
										Please pass on my appreciation for
										the great job they did. I would share with any residential customer my
										experience and how well the men kept the
										job site neat and clean and protected my house from any mess. When the time came
										to raise the slab I watched the
										process and was awed by how the slab was fully put back in place and stabilized.
									</p>

									<p>In conclusion I again want to say thanks for doing a wonderful job, the
										professionalism of all involved and the
										peace of mind that you have given me.</p>

									<p class="headline">Foundation Underpinning and Basement Wall Reinforcement</p>
									<p>I want to commend Geofreeze's workers. I never saw ANYONE work as hard and
										responsibly as Geofreeze's crew
										members. They left no stone unturned to do the job right and were very
										responsive to my needs and questions.
										They worked well together and were very upbeat and pleasant all during the week.
										A homeowner goes through a
										certain amount of stress when her house and yard are being torn up and people in
										and out on many days. The
										crew's attitude made that process a LOT easier for me. From this homeowner's
										point of view, they are surely
										commendable.</p>

									<p class="headline">Crawl Space to Basement Conversion and Interior/Exterior
										Drainage Improvement</p>

									<p>Geofreeze previously created a large expansion of our basement by converting an
										existing crawl space to a full
										depth basement. More recently, they addressed a problem in our original
										basement. The basement areaway drain had
										deteriorated causing flooding during heavy rainfall. Geofreeze installed a new
										sump pump and collector drain and
										made the interior and exterior connections. Once again, they did a great job!

									<p>We had a water problem in our basement caused by poor storm water diversion at

										the basement walls had cracked. Geofreeze reinforced the walls and improved the
										drainage. We are very pleased
										with the work. The crew was courteous and hard-working!</p>

									<p>The masonry basement walls and concrete floor of our home were badly cracked. We

										problems in the basement. Geofreeze reinforced the walls, replaced the floor and
										added drainage improvement.
										They then finished the basement wall framing, ceiling and electrical work,
										leaving it ready for us to finish the
										new living area. Their crew was courteous and professional. They, together with
										Geofreeze's engineering staff,
										addressed situations promptly and efficiently.</p>

									<p class="headline">Foundation Underpinning Repair and Drainage Improvements</p>

									<p>My introduction to Geofreeze was a very comprehensive article in the Washington
										Post's Real Estate section that
										reviewed specialized restorative work for homes, no matter the cause. Geofreeze
										was identified as the company
										that had the full resources to evaluate, solve, strategically plan and actually
										do the work'all within the
										disciplined Geofreeze culture of dedication to excellence. My experience
										verified, with distinction, the entire
										range of services portrayed so favorably for Geofreeze. The Washington Post
										subsequently had an additional
										article that was a recapitulation of a Geofreeze home restoration in Chevy
										Chase. The Geofreeze company team
										applied the above-mentioned positive skill sets to the project at my home. As
										the work proceeded there were
										challenges that were not anticipated, including 85 days of rain out of 100 days.
										Geofreeze adjusted for the
										interruptions and never wavered encountering unforeseen problems on the job
										site. Technically and clinically all
										companies aspire to do work. The real appreciation to Geofreeze is the extra
										comfort to the client embedded in
										the company culture that was demonstrated by Geofreeze - for applying the ethic
										of integrity, loyalty and high
										caliber applications from the entire ranks of the Geofreeze staff.</p>
